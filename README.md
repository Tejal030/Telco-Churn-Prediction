# Telco-Churn-Prediction
Analyzed telecom customer churn to find why users leave and who is at risk. Found higher churn among month-to-month customers, new users, high-charge accounts, and those without support services. Recommended contract incentives, better onboarding, pricing reviews, and promoting auto-pay.
